Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
Input: "UD"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: "LL"
Output: false

/**
 * @param {string} moves
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var judgeCircle = function(moves) {
    moves = moves.replace(/U/g, "0").replace(/D/g, "1").replace(/L/g, "2").replace(/R/g, "3");
    var length = moves.length;
    var array = new Array(length).fill(0);
    for(let i = 0; i < length; i++){
        array[moves[i]]++;
    }
    return (array[0] || 0) - (array[1] || 0) == 0 && (array[2] || 0) - (array[3] || 0) == 0
};
